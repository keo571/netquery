# Sample Queries

This guide provides comprehensive query examples for both **dev mode (SQLite)** and **prod mode (PostgreSQL)** datasets.

## Dataset Overview

### Dev Mode (SQLite)
The dev profile uses SQLite with synthetic load balancer data (see [setup/create_data_sqlite.py](../setup/create_data_sqlite.py)):

**Tables**:
- `load_balancers` - Load balancer instances with VIP addresses
- `servers` - Backend servers with CPU/memory metrics
- `ssl_certificates` - SSL/TLS certificates with expiry tracking
- `vip_pools` - Virtual IP pools with protocol configuration
- `backend_mappings` - Load balancer to server mappings
- `network_traffic` - Traffic metrics (requests/sec, bandwidth, latency)
- `ssl_monitoring` - Daily SSL certificate monitoring aggregates
- `lb_health_log` - Load balancer health scores over time
- `network_connectivity` - Server connectivity metrics (latency, packet loss)

**Scale**: ~50 load balancers, ~50 servers across 4 datacenters (us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-1)

### Prod Mode (PostgreSQL)
The prod profile uses PostgreSQL with a schema from Excel (see [setup/create_data_postgres.py](../setup/create_data_postgres.py)):

**Tables**:
- `load_balancers` - Load balancer instances
- `virtual_ips` - Virtual IP endpoints
- `wide_ips` - Global DNS load balancing (wide IPs)
- `wide_ip_pools` - Pools of virtual IPs for wide IPs
- `backend_servers` - Backend server instances
- `traffic_stats` - Per-VIP traffic statistics

**Scale**: 20-100 rows per table, supports global DNS routing and wide IP configurations

## Tips for Writing Good Queries

### Be Specific About Timeframes
- **Good**: "Show network traffic in the last 24 hours"
- **Bad**: "Show network traffic" (may return too much data)

### Specify What You Want to See
- **Good**: "List load balancers with their datacenter, status, and VIP address"
- **Bad**: "Show load balancers" (may miss important fields)

### Use Natural Language
- **Good**: "Which servers are unhealthy in us-east-1?"
- **Also Good**: "Show me all servers in us-east-1 that have status not equal to healthy"

### Ask for Analysis, Not Just Data
- **Good**: "What's the average requests per second by datacenter?"
- **Less Useful**: "Show all network traffic records" (requires manual calculation)

### Leverage Relationships
- **Good**: "For each load balancer, show its backend servers and their health status"
- **Less Useful**: Asking for load balancers and servers separately (requires manual joining)

### Use Appropriate Filters
- **Good**: "Show servers with CPU above 80% in us-east-1"
- **Good**: "List load balancers created in the last 30 days"

## Differences Between Dev and Prod

| Feature | Dev (SQLite) | Prod (PostgreSQL) |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Complexity** | More tables, detailed monitoring | Simpler schema focused on core LB features |
| **Scale** | ~50 records per table | 20-100 records per table (randomized) |
| **SSL** | Full SSL certificate management | Not included |
| **Global LB** | Not supported | Wide IP support for global DNS routing |
| **Traffic Metrics** | `network_traffic` (time-series) | `traffic_stats` (per-VIP aggregates) |
| **Health Monitoring** | `lb_health_log` with scores | Status fields only |
| **Network Monitoring** | `network_connectivity` detailed | Not included |
| **Servers** | `servers` table with metrics | `backend_servers` table (simpler) |
| **VIPs** | `vip_pools` linked to LBs | `virtual_ips` as separate entities |
| **Use Case** | Development, detailed monitoring, SSL management | Production schema validation, global routing |

### When to Use Each Mode

**Use Dev Mode for**:
- Learning the system with comprehensive data
- Testing queries with time-series data
- SSL certificate management and monitoring
- Network connectivity analysis
- Detailed health score tracking
- Server resource utilization queries

**Use Prod Mode for**:
- Testing against production-like schema structure
- Global load balancing with wide IPs
- Validating schema from Excel definitions
- Simpler load balancer-to-backend relationships
- Wide IP pool configurations

## Query Export Options

All queries support export flags:

```bash
# Export to HTML table
python gemini_cli.py "Show all load balancers" --html

# Export to CSV file
python gemini_cli.py "Show traffic stats" --csv

# Show SQL explanation
python gemini_cli.py "Show servers" --explain
```

Exported files are saved to `query_exports/` directory.

## Next Steps

1. **Try the queries**: Copy any query above and run it with `gemini_cli.py`
2. **Modify and experiment**: Change datacenters, time ranges, or thresholds
3. **Combine filters**: "Show unhealthy servers in us-east-1 with CPU above 80%"
4. **Export results**: Add `--html` or `--csv` to save results
5. **View SQL**: Add `--explain` to understand how queries are translated
